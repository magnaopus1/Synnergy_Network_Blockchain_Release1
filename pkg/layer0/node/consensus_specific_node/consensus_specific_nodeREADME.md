Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Docker
Git
Steps
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/synthron_blockchain.git
cd synthron_blockchain/pkg/layer0/node/consensus_specific_node
Build the Docker Image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t consensus_specific_node .
Run the Docker Container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -d --name consensus_node -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/data:/data consensus_specific_node
Configuration
The config.toml file contains all the necessary configurations for the node. Ensure the configurations align with your network and operational requirements.

Example config.toml:

toml
Copy code
[node]
id = "node-1"
consensus_type = "PoW"
network_address = ":8080"

[storage]
base_path = "./data"
Running the Node
Start the Node
Use the provided start.sh script to start the node:

bash
Copy code
./scripts/start.sh
Stop the Node
Use the provided stop.sh script to stop the node:

bash
Copy code
./scripts/stop.sh
Health Check
Use the provided health_check.sh script to perform health checks on the node:

bash
Copy code
./scripts/health_check.sh
Scripts
start.sh
This script starts the consensus-specific node, initializing all necessary services and establishing network connections.

stop.sh
This script stops the node gracefully, ensuring all processes are terminated correctly.

health_check.sh
This script performs comprehensive health checks on the node, including:

Node running status
Network connectivity
Disk space usage
CPU usage
Memory usage
Development
Code Structure
node.go: Main file containing the logic for the Consensus-Specific Node.
config.toml: Configuration file for setting up the node.
Dockerfile: Dockerfile to build the Docker image for the node.
scripts/: Directory containing startup, shutdown, and health check scripts.
tests/: Directory containing tests for the node implementation.
Dependencies
Ensure all dependencies are listed in your Go modules file (go.mod).
Building
bash
Copy code
go build -o consensus_specific_node node.go
Testing
Run the tests to ensure the node is functioning correctly:

bash
Copy code
go test ./tests/...
Security
Encryption and Decryption
For encryption and decryption, the node uses Scrypt, AES, or Argon2, depending on the specific use case. Salts are used where necessary to enhance security.

Regular Updates
Ensure the node's software and dependencies are regularly updated to mitigate security vulnerabilities.

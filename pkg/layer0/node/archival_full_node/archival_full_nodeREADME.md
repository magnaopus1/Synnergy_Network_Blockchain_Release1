Archival Full Node for Synthron Blockchain
Overview
The Archival Full Node is a critical component of the Synthron blockchain network. It ensures data redundancy, facilitates deep blockchain analytics, and provides a reliable data source for network recovery in case of catastrophic data loss. Unlike Pruned Full Nodes, Archival Full Nodes store the complete record of all transactions and states from the genesis block, offering historical blockchain data necessary for comprehensive audits, research, and advanced data analysis. This document provides a detailed overview of the setup, configuration, and operational guidelines for running an Archival Full Node.

Files and Their Uses
1. Dockerfile
The Dockerfile is used to create a Docker image for the Archival Full Node. It defines the environment and the dependencies required to run the node. This ensures a consistent and reproducible setup, simplifying deployment and scaling.

2. README.md
This file provides comprehensive documentation for the Archival Full Node. It includes setup instructions, usage guidelines, and detailed descriptions of each component. This document serves as the primary resource for understanding and operating the node.

3. config.toml
The config.toml file contains configuration settings for the Archival Full Node. This includes network parameters, storage paths, logging configurations, and other operational settings. It allows for customization and fine-tuning of the node's behavior to suit specific requirements.

4. data
The data directory is where the blockchain data is stored. For an Archival Full Node, this includes the complete transaction history and state data from the genesis block. This directory needs to have sufficient storage capacity to handle the growing blockchain data.

5. logs
The logs directory stores log files generated by the node. These logs provide detailed information about the node's operations, including transaction validation, block propagation, and any errors encountered. Logs are crucial for monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing the node's activity.

6. node.go
The node.go file contains the implementation of the Archival Full Node. This includes the logic for block validation, transaction processing, network communication, and data storage. It is the core component of the node, ensuring it functions correctly within the blockchain network.

7. scripts
The scripts directory contains utility scripts for managing the node.

health_check.sh: This script performs a health check on the node, verifying its status, synchronization, disk space, memory usage, and network connectivity. It helps ensure the node is operating correctly and efficiently.
start.sh: This script is used to start the node. It sets up the necessary environment, initializes the node, and begins its operations.
stop.sh: This script gracefully stops the node, ensuring all operations are completed and data is safely stored before shutting down.
8. tests
The tests directory contains test scripts to verify the functionality of the node.

node_test.go: This file includes tests for the node's implementation, ensuring all functions and methods work as expected. It is essential for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the node.

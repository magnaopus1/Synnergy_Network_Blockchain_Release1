Introduction
Authority Nodes are entrusted with significant responsibilities within the Synthron blockchain, including:

Participating in the consensus process.
Producing and validating blocks.
Voting on governance proposals and protocol changes.
This README provides detailed instructions to ensure your Authority Node operates efficiently and securely.

Hardware and Software Requirements
Hardware Specifications
CPU: Enterprise-grade processors with multiple cores optimized for parallel processing tasks.
Memory: At least 64GB of RAM to ensure smooth transaction processing and block validation.
Storage: Several terabytes of high-speed SSD storage for handling the blockchain database and logs with high IOPS.
Network: Dual or multiple redundant high-speed internet connections to maintain a constant and reliable connection to the blockchain network.
Software Specifications
Operating System: Optimized Linux distributions known for stability and security (e.g., Ubuntu Server, CentOS).
Blockchain Node Software: Customized software regularly updated with the latest security patches and feature enhancements.
Security Enhancements: Automated security patches, intrusion detection systems, comprehensive logging, and monitoring solutions.
Installation
Step-by-Step Installation Guide
Prepare the Environment

Ensure your system meets the hardware and software requirements.
Install necessary dependencies and tools (e.g., curl, wget, git).
Download the Node Software

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/synthron-blockchain/authority_node.git
cd authority_node
Build the Docker Image

bash
Copy code
docker build -t synthron_authority_node .
Create Necessary Directories

bash
Copy code
mkdir -p /var/log/synthron/authority_node
mkdir -p /var/run/synthron
Configuration
Configuration File: config.toml
Customize the configuration file located at ./config.toml to suit your node's requirements.

toml
Copy code
[node]
id = "authority_node"
log_file = "/var/log/synthron/authority_node.log"
pid_file = "/var/run/synthron/authority_node.pid"
data_dir = "/var/lib/synthron/authority_node"

[network]
listen_address = "0.0.0.0:30303"
max_peers = 50
Running the Node
Starting the Node
Use the provided start.sh script to start the node.

bash
Copy code
./scripts/start.sh
Stopping the Node
Use the provided stop.sh script to stop the node safely.

bash
Copy code
./scripts/stop.sh
Health Check
Run the health check script to ensure the node is functioning correctly.

bash
Copy code
./scripts/health_check.sh
Monitoring and Maintenance
Continuous Monitoring
Ensure continuous monitoring of system performance, network connectivity, and blockchain activities. Set up tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and alerting.

Regular Maintenance
Regularly update the node software, perform hardware checks, and conduct security assessments to mitigate risks and address vulnerabilities.

Security Best Practices
Encryption
Use end-to-end encryption (e.g., TLS/SSL) for all data in transit and at rest.
Implement strict access controls and authentication protocols.
Regular Security Audits
Conduct frequent internal and external security audits to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.

Backup and Disaster Recovery
Implement automated backup systems and well-defined disaster recovery plans to restore operations quickly in case of hardware failure or cyber-attacks.

Disaster Recovery
Backup Systems
Regularly back up critical data to multiple secure locations.

Disaster Recovery Plans
Ensure disaster recovery plans are in place and can be executed to restore operations quickly.

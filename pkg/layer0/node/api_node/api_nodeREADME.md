Synthron API Node Documentation
Overview
The Synthron API Node is a vital component of the Synthron blockchain infrastructure, designed to facilitate high-throughput and low-latency interaction with the blockchain. It serves as the primary interface for developers, businesses, and third-party services to interact with the blockchain, providing real-time data provisioning, complex query handling, and transaction submission capabilities.

Features
Dedicated API Gateway: Streamlines the process of querying blockchain data and submitting transactions.
Real-Time Data Provisioning: Provides up-to-the-minute access to blockchain states, balances, transaction histories, and smart contract outputs.
Complex Query Handling: Equipped with advanced query processing capabilities for detailed data analysis.
High Performance: Utilizes high-performance CPUs, large-scale RAM, and high-speed SSDs to ensure rapid data processing.
Enhanced Security: Implements robust security measures including endpoint security, encryption protocols, and regular security audits.
File Descriptions
Dockerfile
The Dockerfile sets up the environment for running the API Node. It includes steps for setting up dependencies, copying source files, and building the project.

api_nodeREADME.md
This documentation file provides an overview of the API Node, its features, technical infrastructure, and file descriptions.

config.toml
The configuration file for the API Node. It includes settings for node identification, security, network, storage, protocol support, external data integration, performance, security audits, authentication, mining settings, and miscellaneous settings.

data/
This directory is used to store blockchain data, including the node's local copy of the blockchain and other relevant data files.

logs/
This directory contains log files generated by the API Node for tracking its operations and troubleshooting issues.

node.go
The main Go source file for the API Node. It implements the core functionalities, including starting/stopping the node, handling connections, encrypting/decrypting data, sending transactions, querying the blockchain, integrating external data, authenticating users, performing security audits, and enhancing transaction routing.

scripts/
health_check.sh
A script to perform health checks on the API Node, including checking if services are running, disk space usage, network connectivity, performing security audits, and checking SSL certificate expiration.

start.sh
A script to start the API Node, ensuring all required services are running, initializing the node environment, starting the API Node process, checking SSL certificate expiration, and performing a security audit.

stop.sh
A script to stop the API Node, performing a final security audit, backing up node data, gracefully shutting down the API Node process, and stopping related services.

tests/node_test.go
A comprehensive test suite for the API Node, ensuring it meets the highest standards for real-world deployment. The tests cover node lifecycle management, data encryption/decryption, authentication and verification, external data integration, security audits, transaction handling, blockchain querying, and enhanced transaction routing.

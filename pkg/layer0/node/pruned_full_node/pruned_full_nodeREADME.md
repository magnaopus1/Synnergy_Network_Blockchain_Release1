Pruned Full Node for Synthron Blockchain
Overview
The Pruned Full Node is an essential component of the Synthron blockchain, ensuring the integrity and efficiency of the network while maintaining a smaller storage footprint compared to Archival Full Nodes. Pruned Full Nodes store the entire block header chain and a subset of transaction data, optimizing storage usage while ensuring all new transactions and blocks can be validated against the network's consensus rules. This document provides a comprehensive guide for setting up, configuring, and maintaining a Pruned Full Node.


Files and Their Uses
1. Dockerfile
The Dockerfile defines the environment and dependencies required to run the Pruned Full Node. It ensures a consistent and reproducible setup, simplifying deployment and scaling.

2. config.toml
The config.toml file contains configuration settings for the Pruned Full Node. This includes network parameters, storage paths, logging configurations, and other operational settings, allowing customization and fine-tuning of the node's behavior.

3. data
The data directory stores the blockchain data, including the entire block header chain and pruned transaction data. This directory requires sufficient storage capacity to handle the growing blockchain data efficiently.

4. logs
The logs directory stores log files generated by the node, providing detailed information about the node's operations, including transaction validation, block propagation, and any errors encountered. Logs are crucial for monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing the node's activity.

5. node.go
The node.go file contains the implementation of the Pruned Full Node, including the logic for block validation, transaction processing, network communication, and data storage. It is the core component of the node, ensuring it functions correctly within the blockchain network.

6. scripts
The scripts directory contains utility scripts for managing the node.

health_check.sh: This script performs a health check on the node, verifying its status, synchronization, disk space, memory usage, and network connectivity, ensuring the node operates correctly and efficiently.
start.sh: This script is used to start the node, setting up the necessary environment, initializing the node, and beginning its operations.
stop.sh: This script gracefully stops the node, ensuring all operations are completed and data is safely stored before shutting down.
7. tests
The tests directory contains test scripts to verify the functionality of the node.

node_test.go: This file includes tests for the node's implementation, ensuring all functions and methods work as expected. It is essential for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the node.

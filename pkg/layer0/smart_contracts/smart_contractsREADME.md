Synthron Blockchain Smart Contracts
This repository contains a comprehensive suite of tools and libraries for creating, deploying, and managing smart contracts on the Synthron blockchain. The project is designed to the highest production standards to ensure real-world usability, security, and efficiency. The implementation leverages Golang for its robust development ecosystem, with extensive support for smart contracts, Ricardian contracts, and smart contract templates.

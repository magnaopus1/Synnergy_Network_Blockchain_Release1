Fraud Prevention Systems - Risk Scoring and Mitigation

This module implements risk scoring and mitigation algorithms for fraud prevention systems
within the Synnergy Network. Risk scoring and mitigation is used to assess the likelihood
of fraudulent behavior and take appropriate actions to mitigate risks.

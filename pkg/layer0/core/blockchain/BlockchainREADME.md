Module Descriptions
Address Management (address/address.go)
Responsible for generating and validating blockchain addresses, critical for ensuring that transactions are sent and received securely.

Block Management (block/block.go)
Handles the core functionality of blocks within the blockchain including creation, validation, and linking to form the blockchain.

Blockchain Compression (blockchain_compression/blockchain_compression.go)
Applies advanced data compression algorithms to optimize storage and bandwidth, enhancing overall network performance.

Chain Management (chain/chain.go)
Maintains the blockchain's integrity by managing the linkage of blocks and ensuring no alterations or inconsistencies disrupt the blockchain sequence.

Cryptographic Services (crypto/crypto.go)
Provides essential cryptographic functionalities such as encryption for secure data transmission, hashing for data integrity, and digital signatures for authentication.

Dynamic Block Sizing (dynamic_block_sizing/dynamic_block_sizing.go)
Adjusts the size of blocks dynamically based on real-time transaction volumes to balance network load and optimize processing speeds.

Finality Mechanisms (finality/finality.go)
Implements mechanisms like checkpoints and finalized blocks to provide certainty that once transactions are recorded, they are irreversible and immutable.

Multi-Factor Authentication (multi_factor_authentication/multi_factor_authentication.go)
Enhances security by requiring multiple forms of verification before transactions can be executed, protecting against unauthorized access.

Predictive Chain Management (predictive_chain_management/predictive_chain_management.go)
Utilizes machine learning algorithms to anticipate and prevent potential forks and chain reorganizations, ensuring network stability.

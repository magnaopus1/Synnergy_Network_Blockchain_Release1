Synthron Blockchain Transactions Module
Overview
The transaction module of the Synthron Blockchain is designed to handle all aspects of transactions within the network. This includes broadcasting, control, fee management, history, mempool, private transactions, receipts, security, transaction types, and validation. This README provides a comprehensive guide for developers and users to understand and use the functionalities provided by this module.

Receipts
transaction_chargebacks.go: Manages chargebacks for transactions.
transaction_receipts.go: Generates and verifies transaction receipts for proof of execution.
Security
minimum_stake_validator.go: Ensures validators meet the minimum staking requirements.
slashing_conditions.go: Defines conditions under which validators can be penalized.
transaction_security.go: Implements security measures for transactions.
Transaction Types
transaction_smart_contract.go: Handles transactions involving smart contracts.
transaction_standard.go: Manages standard transactions.
transaction_token_transfer.go: Manages token transfer transactions.
Validation
transaction_metrics.go: Collects and analyzes transaction metrics.
transaction_validation.go: Validates transactions before they are included in a block.
transaction_verification.go: Verifies the authenticity and integrity of transactions.
CLI and API Integration
CLI
The Synthron CLI will include commands to interact with the transaction module, enabling users and developers to manage transactions, fees, and validation processes. Key commands include:

synthron tx broadcast: Broadcast a new transaction to the network.
synthron tx cancel: Cancel a pending transaction.
synthron tx reverse: Reverse a completed transaction.
synthron tx schedule: Schedule a transaction for future execution.
synthron tx history: View transaction history.
synthron tx search: Search for transactions based on criteria.
synthron tx fees calculate: Calculate transaction fees.
synthron tx fees distribute: Distribute collected fees.
synthron tx private convert: Convert a transaction to a private transaction.
synthron tx private manage: Manage private transactions.
synthron tx receipt generate: Generate a transaction receipt.
synthron tx receipt verify: Verify a transaction receipt.
synthron tx validate: Validate a transaction.
synthron tx verify: Verify the authenticity of a transaction.

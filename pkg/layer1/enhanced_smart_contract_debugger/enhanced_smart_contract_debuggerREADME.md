# Enhanced Smart Contract Debugger

## Overview
The Enhanced Smart Contract Debugger is designed to provide developers with powerful tools to debug smart contracts on the Synthron Blockchain. This module includes functionalities for detailed tracing, breakpoint management, and encrypted logging of debugging sessions.

## Features
- **Detailed Contract Execution Tracing:** Allows developers to trace the execution of smart contracts step-by-step to understand the flow and identify any unexpected behaviors.
- **Breakpoint Management:** Developers can set and manage breakpoints to pause contract execution at critical points and inspect the state and variables.
- **Encrypted Log Management:** All outputs and states during the debugging process are securely logged with encryption to ensure that sensitive information is protected.

## Components
- `smart_contract_debugger.go`: Contains the core functionalities for starting a debugging session, setting breakpoints, and executing smart contracts step-by-step.
- `smart_contract_debugger_tests.go`: Provides a comprehensive suite of tests to ensure the reliability and security of the debugger functionalities.

## Setup and Configuration
To set up the Enhanced Smart Contract Debugger, ensure that your environment is equipped with Go 1.15 or later and access to the Synthron Blockchain nodes for deploying and interacting with smart contracts.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the debugger directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/enhanced_smart_contract_debugger

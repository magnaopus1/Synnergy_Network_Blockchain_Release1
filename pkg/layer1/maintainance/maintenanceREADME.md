## Modules Description

### 1. Optimization Scripts (`optimization_scripts.go`)

This module contains scripts designed to optimize the performance of the blockchain network. It includes garbage collection routines, memory optimization, and database indexing to ensure optimal performance.

- **Key Functions:**
  - `OptimizeMemoryUsage()`: Reduces the memory overhead of the blockchain nodes.
  - `OptimizeDatabase()`: Reindexes the blockchain database to speed up query response times.

### 2. System Checks (`system_checks.go`)

Responsible for conducting routine system health checks to ensure all components of the blockchain are functioning as expected. This includes checking node health, network connectivity, and data integrity.

- **Key Functions:**
  - `CheckNodeHealth()`: Ensures each node in the network is operating correctly.
  - `VerifyNetworkConnectivity()`: Confirms that there is consistent and reliable network connectivity between nodes.

### 3. Update Mechanisms (`update_mechanisms.go`)

Handles the secure updating of blockchain node software. It ensures that all nodes are running the most secure and efficient version of the software with minimal downtime.

- **Key Functions:**
  - `FetchUpdate()`: Retrieves the latest software updates from a central repository.
  - `ApplyUpdate()`: Safely applies updates to the blockchain nodes.

## Security Features

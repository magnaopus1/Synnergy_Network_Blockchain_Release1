## Module Description
The Advanced Interledger Protocols module includes several components designed to enable cross-chain transactions, setup interledger environments, and ensure robust testing frameworks are in place. This module is crucial for operations that involve multiple blockchain networks.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure that your environment is configured with Go 1.15 or later and has access to the Synthron Blockchain network configurations.
2. **Dependency Installation**: Install all necessary dependencies using `go get` to ensure that all related libraries are up to date.

## Configuration Guide
- **Protocol Configuration**: Set up the initial interledger protocol parameters in `interledger_setup.go`.
- **Security Settings**: Define encryption standards and key management practices in `interledger_protocols.go`.

## Functionalities
- **Cross-Chain Transactions**: Implemented in `cross_chain_transactions.go`, this functionality supports the execution of transactions across different blockchain platforms.
- **Protocol Setup and Initialization**: Detailed in `interledger_setup.go`, this setup defines how the protocols initialize secure channels and session keys.
- **Testing and Validation**: `interledger_testing.go` includes a suite of tests to validate the integrity and security of interledger transactions.

## Testing
Testing is a critical component of the Advanced Interledger Protocols. To run the tests:
```bash
go test -v ./...

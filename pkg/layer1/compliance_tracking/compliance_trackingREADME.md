# Compliance Tracking System

## Overview

The Compliance Tracking System in the Synthron Blockchain provides robust tools to manage, log, and audit compliance-related activities across the network. This system is designed to support stringent regulatory requirements and ensure transparency and accountability in all operations involving token management and transaction processing.

## Features

- **Compliance Management**: Manages the application and tracking of compliance rules across different blockchain entities.
- **Compliance Tracking System**: Logs all compliance-related events and encrypts them to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
- **Advanced Security**: Utilizes top-grade encryption algorithms such as AES-GCM and Argon2 to secure data against unauthorized access.

## Modules

### Compliance Management

This module facilitates the creation and maintenance of compliance policies applicable to various tokens and transactions within the blockchain. It provides tools to set, update, and retrieve compliance policies dynamically.

- **File:** `compliance_management.go`
- **Main Functions:**
  - `SetFiscalPolicy`: Sets or updates the fiscal policy for a specific token.
  - `GetFiscalPolicy`: Retrieves the fiscal policy for a specific token.
  - `ApplyInflation`: Applies the inflation rate defined in the fiscal policy to adjust token supply.

### Compliance Tracking System

This module captures and securely logs all compliance events, providing a reliable audit trail for regulatory reviews and internal audits.

- **File:** `compliance_tracking_system.go`
- **Main Functions:**
  - `LogEvent`: Securely logs compliance events, encrypting the data to preserve confidentiality.
  - `RetrieveEvent`: Fetches and decrypts compliance events for review and auditing purposes.

## Getting Started

To integrate the Compliance Tracking System within your blockchain infrastructure, follow these steps:

1. **Initialization**: Instantiate the `ComplianceManager` and `ComplianceTracker` with an AES encryption key.

   ```go
   key := []byte("your-256-bit-secret")
   complianceManager := NewComplianceManager(key)
   complianceTracker := NewComplianceTracker(key)

Logging Compliance Events: Utilize the LogEvent method to log any action that requires compliance tracking.
go
Copy code
complianceTracker.LogEvent("Token Creation", "Token123", "Compliance data details")
Retrieving and Auditing Events: Use the RetrieveEvent method to access logged events for audits.
go
Copy code
event, err := complianceTracker.RetrieveEvent("event_id")
if err != nil {
    log.Println("Error retrieving event:", err)
}

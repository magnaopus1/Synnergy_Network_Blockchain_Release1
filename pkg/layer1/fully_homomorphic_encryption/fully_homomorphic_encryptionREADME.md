# Fully Homomorphic Encryption Module

## Overview

This module implements Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), enabling computations on encrypted data without requiring access to a secret (private) key. FHE allows data to remain encrypted and secure throughout its lifecycle, from encryption, through various computations, to decryption. This capability is crucial for ensuring data privacy in decentralized applications, especially within financial, health, and public sectors where sensitive data must be handled with strict confidentiality.

## Features

- **Security**: Implements the latest standards in homomorphic encryption to ensure robust data protection.
- **Flexibility**: Supports various operations on encrypted data, including additions and multiplications, which are fundamental for complex arithmetic computations.
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance with considerations for latency and computational overhead, making it viable for real-world applications.
- **Integration**: Designed for easy integration with existing blockchain platforms and supports a variety of programming languages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.15 or later.
- Basic understanding of cryptographic principles.

### Installation

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://example.com/synthron_blockchain.git
Navigate to the fully homomorphic encryption module directory:
bash
Copy code
cd synthron_blockchain/pkg/layer1/fully_homomorphic_encryption
Usage
To integrate the FHE module into your application, follow these steps:

Import the Module:
go
Copy code
import "path/to/fully_homomorphic_encryption"
Initialize the Encryptor:
go
Copy code
key, _ := GenerateSecureKey()
encryptor, _ := NewHomomorphicEncryptor(key)
Encrypt Data:
go
Copy code
encryptedData, _ := encryptor.Encrypt([]byte("sensitive data"))
Perform Computations on Encrypted Data:
go
Copy code
// Example: Adding encrypted values
result, _ := encryptor.Add(encryptedData, otherEncryptedData)
Decrypt Data:
go
Copy code
decryptedData, _ := encryptor.Decrypt(result)

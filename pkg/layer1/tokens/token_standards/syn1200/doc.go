package syn1200

// Package syn1200 implements the SYN1200 Token Standard for the Synthron Blockchain.
// This standard provides a framework for creating tokens that facilitate interoperability
// between different blockchain systems, enabling seamless asset transfers and atomic swaps.
//
// Overview:
// The SYN1200 standard is designed to support complex token interactions across multiple
// blockchains, making it ideal for scenarios where assets need to move freely between
// different networks without the need for intermediaries. It includes mechanisms for linking
// tokens to multiple blockchains, initiating and completing atomic swaps, and handling
// events related to these activities.
//
// Key Features:
// - Multi-Blockchain Linking: Tokens can be linked to multiple blockchains, allowing them
//   to be recognized and utilized across these platforms.
// - Atomic Swaps: The standard includes built-in support for atomic swaps, enabling trustless
//   exchanges of assets between parties on different blockchains.
// - Event Logging: All actions, including blockchain linking and atomic swaps, are logged
//   through a detailed event system, which helps in tracking the token history and audits.
//
// Usage:
// The SYN1200 standard can be integrated into applications requiring cross-chain compatibility,
// such as decentralized exchanges, multi-chain wallets, and cross-chain dApps. Developers can
// utilize this standard to create tokens that not only serve as a medium of exchange on a single
// network but also across multiple networks, enhancing the liquidity and utility of the assets.
//
// Example Implementation:
// The following is a basic example of how to create a new SYN1200 token, link it to multiple
// blockchains, initiate an atomic swap, and log the associated events:
//
//  func ExampleUsage() {
//      token := syn1200.NewInteroperableToken("tokenXYZ", "user123", 1000, []string{"Ethereum", "Polygon"})
//      token.LinkBlockchain("BinanceChain")
//      token.InitiateAtomicSwap("BinanceChain", "swap002")
//      token.CompleteAtomicSwap("swap002")
//      fmt.Println(token.GetTokenDetails())
//  }
//
// This package forms an integral part of the broader Synthron Blockchain ecosystem, aimed at
// enhancing interoperability and fluidity across the blockchain landscape.

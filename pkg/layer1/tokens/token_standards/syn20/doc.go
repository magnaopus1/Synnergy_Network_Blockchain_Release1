package syn20


// Package syn20 implements the SYN20 token standard for the Synthron Blockchain.
// This token standard is designed to facilitate the creation, transfer, and management
// of fungible digital assets, analogous to the ERC-20 standard on the Ethereum platform.
//
// Overview
//
// The SYN20 token standard defines a set of APIs for fungible tokens within the
// Synthron Blockchain ecosystem. This includes basic functionalities such as transferring tokens,
// approving tokens to be spent by third parties, and accessing data about the token, including
// the total supply and balance of tokens held by an account.
//
// This standard is crucial for ensuring compatibility among various tokens and making it easier
// for developers to implement standardized token interfaces in their applications, such as wallets
// and decentralized exchanges.
//
// Features
//
// 1. Basic Token Operations: Includes methods for transferring tokens between accounts, checking the balance
//    of tokens in an account, and approving tokens to be spent by third-party accounts.
//
// 2. Events: Utilizes an event system to notify subscribers about changes such as transfers and approvals,
//    enabling applications to react to these events in real-time.
//
// 3. Compliance and Extensions: Ensures compliance with common token functionalities while allowing for
//    extensions and customizations to support additional features needed by token issuers.
//
// Usage
//
// To interact with SYN20 tokens, developers will utilize the Token interface which provides methods
// for performing operations and querying state. Here is a quick example on how to instantiate a
// token contract and execute a transfer:
//
//     token, err := syn20.NewToken("TokenName", "SYM", 1000000, "creatorPublicKey")
//     if err != nil {
//         log.Fatal(err)
//     }
//
//     err = token.Transfer("recipientPublicKey", 100)
//     if err != nil {
//         log.Println("Failed to transfer tokens:", err)
//     }
//
// Implementing the SYN20 Token Standard requires handling the underlying blockchain interactions,
// managing state persistence, and ensuring security practices, especially for operations that update
// the token state.
//
// For more details on the API and integration, refer to the individual function and type declarations
// in this package.
//
// Security Considerations
//
// Token implementations should consider security aspects such as reentrancy attacks, integer overflows,
// and compliance with financial regulations depending on the jurisdiction. Regular security audits
// and rigorous testing are recommended to ensure that the token contracts are secure and function
// as expected.
//
// For further guidance on security best practices, visit the Synthron Blockchain developer documentation
// or consult with blockchain security experts.

// Note: The actual implementation files should provide detailed logging at each step of the operations
// to facilitate debugging and provide clear runtime diagnostics. This includes logging access controls,
// changes to the state, and error handling.

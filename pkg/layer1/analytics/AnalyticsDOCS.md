## Components

### Analytics Engine (`analytics_engine.go`)

- **Purpose**: Orchestrates all analytics activities, initiating data gathering, processing, and output generation.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `AnalyzeTransactions`: Analyze raw transaction data.
  - `GenerateBehaviorMetrics`: Produce metrics based on user behaviors.
  - `PrepareDataVisualization`: Prepare data for visual output.

### Data Visualization (`data_visualization.go`)

- **Purpose**: Converts analyzed data into visual formats such as graphs and charts to enhance understanding and reporting.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `GenerateCharts`: Create charts from statistical data.
  - `GenerateGraphs`: Construct graphs to depict relationships and patterns.

### Network Performance (`network_performance.go`)

- **Purpose**: Monitors the blockchain network to provide real-time performance metrics.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `MonitorLatency`: Track and report network latency.
  - `AnalyzeThroughput`: Analyze and report network throughput.

### Report Generator (`report_generator.go`)

- **Purpose**: Aggregates all analytics data and generates comprehensive reports.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `GeneratePDFReport`: Output detailed PDF reports.
  - `GenerateHTMLReport`: Create interactive HTML report summaries.

### Security Analytics (`security_analytics.go`)

- **Purpose**: Focuses on identifying and mitigating security risks within the blockchain network.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `DetectAnomalies`: Identify unusual patterns that may indicate security threats.
  - `AuditSecurityLogs`: Audit logs for potential security incidents.

### Transaction Patterns (`transaction_patterns.go`)

- **Purpose**: Analyzes transaction data to distinguish between typical and atypical transaction patterns.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `IdentifyFraudPatterns`: Detect potential fraud based on deviations from normal transaction patterns.
  - `VisualizeTransactionFlow`: Visualize flows of transactions to aid in identifying bottlenecks or unusual paths.

## Getting Started

To start using the analytics module, include it in your project by importing it into your blockchain application. Here’s a basic example of setting up the analytics engine in a Go application:

```go
package main

import (
    "synthron_blockchain_final/pkg/layer1/analytics"
)

func main() {
    // Initialize analytics components
    analyticsEngine := analytics.NewAnalyticsEngine()

    // Perform analysis
    analyticsEngine.PerformComprehensiveAnalysis()
}

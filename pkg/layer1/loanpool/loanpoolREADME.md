# Loan Pool System Documentation

## Overview
The Loan Pool system is designed to facilitate automated loan operations for liquidity-needy projects within our blockchain ecosystem.

The Loan Pool aims to provide quick access to funds, ensuring continuous project operations and supporting new initiatives that require immediate funding.

## Features

- **Affordability Checks**: Ensures that loans are only granted to projects that can sustain repayment schedules without compromising their operational efficiency.
- **Real-time Loan Calculations**: Offers tools for real-time calculation of loan terms, interest rates, and amortization schedules.
- **Notification Systems**: Automated alerts for borrowers about key loan events (e.g., due payments, risk reassessments).

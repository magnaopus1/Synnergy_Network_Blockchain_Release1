	return `
## Configuration

The node package allows for extensive configuration to meet various requirements. Configuration parameters can be set 
in the configuration file or passed as environment variables. Key configuration options include:

- SecurityConfig: Parameters for Argon2 and Scrypt hashing, AES encryption settings.
- MonitoringConfig: Parameters for node monitoring and real-time analytics.
- NetworkConfig: Parameters for network settings, including IP addresses, ports, and communication protocols.

Example Configuration File (config.json):
\`\`\`json
{
  "SecurityConfig": {
    "Argon2Time": 1,
    "Argon2Memory": 65536,
    "Argon2Threads": 4,
    "Argon2KeyLen": 32,
    "ScryptN": 32768,
    "ScryptR": 8,
    "ScryptP": 1,
    "ScryptKeyLen": 32,
    "EncryptionKeySize": 32
  },
  "MonitoringConfig": {
    "Enable": true,
    "LogLevel": "INFO"
  },
  "NetworkConfig": {
    "NodeIP": "127.0.0.1",
    "NodePort": 8080
  }
}

// getUsage provides usage instructions for the node package.
func getUsage() string {
	return `
## Usage

To use the node package, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the node with the desired configuration:
   \`\`\`go
   config := LoadConfig("config.json")
   node := NewNode(config)
   \`\`\`

2. Start the node to begin participating in the blockchain network:
   \`\`\`go
   err := node.Start()
   if err != nil {
       log.Fatalf("Failed to start node: %v", err)
   }
   \`\`\`

3. Monitor the node's activities and performance:
   \`\`\`go
   stats := node.GetStats()
   fmt.Printf("Node Stats: %+v\n", stats)
   \`\`\`

4. Implement custom logic and functionalities as needed:
   \`\`\`go
   // Custom transaction validation
   func (n *Node) ValidateTransaction(tx Transaction) bool {
       // Add custom validation logic
       return true
   }
   \`\`\`

For more advanced usage and examples, refer to the detailed documentation provided in the package.

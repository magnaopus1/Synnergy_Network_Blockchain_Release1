Usage:

To use this package, first import it into your project:

    import "github.com/synnergy_network_blockchain/pkg/synnergy_network/sidechains/peg"

Then, create an instance of the desired service and call the appropriate methods:

    func main() {
        assetService := peg.NewAssetCreationService()
        err := assetService.CreateAsset("AssetName", "AssetSymbol", 1000000)
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatalf("Failed to create asset: %v", err)
        }
        // Additional usage...
    }

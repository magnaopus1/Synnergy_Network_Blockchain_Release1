# Transaction Monitoring System

The Transaction Monitoring System is a pivotal component of the Synnergy Network, providing continuous oversight of all transactions to detect and prevent fraudulent or illicit activities. This system leverages Golang's concurrency features and robust database capabilities to ensure efficient, real-time monitoring of blockchain transactions.

## File Overview

### anomaly_detection_system.go
This file implements the anomaly detection system that identifies suspicious transactions based on predefined criteria and patterns. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of anomaly detection.

### behavioural_analysis.go
This file contains tools for analyzing user behavior. By monitoring user interactions and transaction patterns, the system can detect deviations from normal activities, which may indicate compromised accounts or insider threats.

### compliance_reporting.go
This file manages the generation of compliance reports. It ensures that all transactions adhere to regulatory standards and provides detailed reports for audit purposes.

### concurrency_handling.go
This file handles concurrency in the transaction monitoring system. It uses Goroutines and channels to efficiently process multiple transactions simultaneously, ensuring scalable and responsive transaction monitoring.

### predictive_monitoring.go
This file implements predictive monitoring features. It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze historical transaction data and predict potential fraudulent activities, allowing proactive measures to be taken.

### real_time_alerts.go
This file manages real-time alerts. When a suspicious transaction is detected, the system generates alerts to notify the appropriate parties immediately, enabling swift action to mitigate risks.

### structured_storage_anad_querying.go
This file provides functionalities for structured storage and querying of transaction data. It uses the `database/sql` package to store transaction records in a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL, enabling efficient retrieval and analysis.

### transaction_classification.go
This file implements the transaction classification system. It categorizes transactions based on predefined rules and patterns, aiding in the identification of suspicious activities.

### transaction_dashboard.go
This file manages the transaction monitoring dashboard. It provides a real-time overview of the transaction monitoring system, displaying total transactions, detected anomalies, and recent transactions.

### transaction_monitoring.go
This file is the core of the transaction monitoring system. It integrates various components such as anomaly detection, predictive monitoring, and behavioral analysis to provide comprehensive transaction monitoring.

### transaction_monitoringREADME.md
This README file provides an overview of the transaction monitoring system, explaining the functionality of each component and how to use the system.

### transaction_monitoring_test.go
This file contains tests for the transaction monitoring system. It ensures that all components work correctly and efficiently, and that the system meets the required standards for production deployment.

## Setup and Usage

1. **Setup Database**: Ensure that you have a PostgreSQL or MySQL database set up and configured. Update the database connection strings in the respective files.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Golang installed. Install necessary packages using `go get`.

3. **Run the System**: Use the `go run` command to start the transaction monitoring system. Ensure that all necessary services (e.g., NATS for real-time alerts) are running.

4. **Monitor Transactions**: The system will start monitoring transactions in real-time. Use the transaction dashboard to view the status and details of monitored transactions.

5. **Handle Alerts**: Configure alert handling to notify the appropriate parties when suspicious transactions are detected. Customize the alert criteria as needed.

## Contributing

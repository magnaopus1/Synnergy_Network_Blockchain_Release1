### compliance_audit.go

Provides functionality for conducting compliance audits, ensuring that data protection measures are in place and effective. It helps in maintaining adherence to regulatory standards and internal policies.

### data_masking.go

Implements data masking techniques to protect sensitive information during transactions. This ensures that personally identifiable information (PII) and other confidential data are obscured from unauthorized access without compromising transaction transparency.

### data_protection.go

The main file for the data protection module. It integrates various data protection features such as encryption, secure communication, and key management, providing a cohesive approach to safeguarding sensitive information on the blockchain.

### data_protection_test.go

Contains comprehensive tests for the data protection module. These tests ensure that encryption, secure communication, key management, and other data protection features are functioning correctly and securely.

### data_retention_policies.go

Defines data retention policies to ensure that data is stored securely for the necessary duration and then properly deleted or anonymized. This helps in complying with regulatory requirements and minimizing the risk of data breaches.

### encryption.go

Implements AES encryption for data at rest and other encryption mechanisms as needed. Ensures that sensitive information stored on disk or in databases remains protected even if physical storage devices are compromised.

### incident_response_plan.go

Details the incident response plan for data breaches or other security incidents. This includes procedures for identifying, responding to, and mitigating the effects of such incidents to minimize damage and ensure rapid recovery.

### key_management.go

Provides functionality for generating, managing, and storing cryptographic keys using RSA or Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). Ensures that only authorized parties have access to encrypted data through secure key exchange protocols.

### privacy_settings.go

Defines privacy settings and controls to help users manage their data privacy preferences. Ensures that data protection measures align with users' expectations and regulatory requirements.

### secure_communication.go

Implements Transport Layer Security (TLS) for secure communication channels between network nodes. Protects data transmitted over the network from eavesdropping and interception, preserving its confidentiality.

### zero_knowledge_proofs.go

Integrates zero-knowledge proofs to enable transaction validation without revealing any underlying data. This ensures privacy-preserving transactions while maintaining the integrity of the blockchain.

## Getting Started

To use the data protection module, import the necessary packages and initialize the required components. Refer to the individual files for specific usage instructions and examples.

## Testing

Run the tests in `data_protection_test.go` to ensure that all data protection features are functioning correctly. Use the following command to run the tests:

```sh
go test ./...

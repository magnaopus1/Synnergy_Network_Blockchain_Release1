Synthron Blockchain Node Management
Overview
Node management is a crucial aspect of maintaining a healthy and resilient blockchain network. It involves tasks such as node discovery, health monitoring, and registration to ensure the network's stability and efficiency. This document outlines the structure and functionalities of the node management system implemented in the Synthron Blockchain using Golang. It covers node discovery, health checks, and registration processes.

Security
For encryption and decryption, we use the most secure methods suitable for each situation:

Scrypt: For password-based key derivation.
AES: For symmetric encryption.
Argon 2: For password hashing.
Salts are used whenever necessary to ensure the highest level of security.

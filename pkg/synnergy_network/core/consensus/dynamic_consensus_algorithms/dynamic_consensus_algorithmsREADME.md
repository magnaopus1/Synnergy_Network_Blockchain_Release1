# Dynamic Consensus Algorithms

## Overview
The `dynamic_consensus_algorithms` package is an integral part of the Synthron Blockchain, facilitating adaptable consensus mechanisms that are crucial for maintaining network flexibility and scalability. This package allows for consensus parameters to be dynamically adjusted based on real-time network conditions, enhancing the blockchain's adaptability and responsiveness to changes in network load or threat landscapes.

## Features
- **Dynamic Parameter Adjustment**: Enables real-time modification of consensus critical parameters such as block time, transaction throughput, and security measures.
- **Hybrid Consensus Options**: Supports hybrid models combining Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and other consensus mechanisms to optimize for both security and energy efficiency.
- **Scalability and Security**: Designed to scale securely with the network while protecting against common threats in decentralized consensus environments.
- **Encryption and Security**: Utilizes top-tier cryptographic standards (Scrypt, AES, Argon2) to secure all adjustments and state transitions within the consensus process.

## Components
- `dynamic_consensus.go`: Core implementation file containing logic for parameter adjustments and consensus state management.
- `dynamic_consensus_test.go`: Contains comprehensive tests to ensure reliability and security of the consensus adjustments.
- `dynamic_consensus_algorithmsREADME.md`: Provides documentation and usage guidelines.

## Usage Example
```go
package main

import (
    "synthron/dynamicconsensus"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    manager := dynamicconsensus.NewConsensusManager([]byte("your-secure-key"))
    manager.AdjustParameters(10*time.Second, 5.0, 3000)
}

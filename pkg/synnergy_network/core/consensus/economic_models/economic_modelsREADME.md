Economic Models in Synnergy Network
This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the economic models implemented in the Synnergy Network blockchain. These models are designed to create a sustainable, efficient, and secure network by incentivizing participation, optimizing resource allocation, and implementing effective transaction fee strategies.

Economic Models
Economic models within Synnergy Network define how transactions are processed, miners are rewarded, and how various stakeholders interact within the ecosystem to ensure ongoing viability and security of the platform.

Incentive Strategies
Incentive strategies are designed to motivate and engage network participants, including miners, validators, and users. These strategies include:

1. Token Rewards
Token Distribution (token_distribution.go): Smart contracts distribute tokens to participants based on their contributions.
Token Rewards (token_rewards.go): Rewards for mining, staking, and governance input.
2. Dynamic Incentives
Dynamic Incentives (dynamic_incentives.go): Adaptive models that adjust rewards based on network conditions.
Incentive Adjustment (incentive_adjustment.go): Real-time adjustment of incentives to ensure optimal resource allocation.
3. Behavioural Incentives
Behavioural Incentives (behavioural_incentives.go): Incentives based on principles from behavioral economics.
Loyalty Tokens (loyalty_tokens.go): Tokens that increase in value based on positive contributions.
Resource Allocation Models
Resource allocation models ensure optimal utilization of computational and storage resources.

1. Allocation Algorithms
Network Congestion (network_congestion.go): Algorithms that adjust resource allocation based on congestion levels.
Participant Stake (participant_stake.go): Prioritizes users with higher stakes.
Transaction Importance (transaction_importance.go): Allocates resources based on transaction importance.
2. Auction Systems
Auction Mechanisms (auction_mechanisms.go): Allows users to bid on network resources.
Dynamic Allocation (dynamic_allocation.go): Real-time resource allocation based on auction results.
3. Predictive Allocation
Predictive Models (predictive_models.go): Machine learning algorithms to forecast resource needs.
Resource Forecasting (resource_forecasting.go): Predicts future resource requirements.
Transaction Fee Models
Transaction fee models ensure fair compensation for participants involved in processing and validating transactions.

1. Variable Fee Structures
Fee Adjustment (fee_adjustment.go): Adjusts fees based on network conditions.
Operation Type Fees (operation_type_fees.go): Fees based on the type of blockchain operation.
Transaction Size (transaction_size.go): Fees based on transaction size.
2. Fee Redistribution
Community Rewards (community_rewards.go): Distributes a portion of fees back to network participants.
Funding Public Goods (funding_public_goods.go): Allocates fees to fund public goods and community-driven initiatives.
3. Zero-Fee Transactions
Zero-Fee Policy (zero_fee_policy.go): Allows zero-fee transactions under specific conditions.
Utility Functions
Utility functions support the economic models with necessary calculations and validations.

Calculations (calculations.go): Functions for stake weight calculation and other computations.
Validators (validators.go): Manages validator sets and their statuses.

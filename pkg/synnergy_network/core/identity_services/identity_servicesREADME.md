Directory Structure and Functionalities
access_control
This directory contains implementations that manage access permissions and security policies across the network.

abac.go: Implements Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) systems that use user attributes to make access decisions.
access_control.go: Provides general configurations and utilities for access control systems.
dac.go: Contains functionalities for Dynamic Access Control (DAC) that adapt access rights based on changing information.
keys_management.go: Manages cryptographic keys used across the network for securing transactions and data.
rbac.go: Implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) where access decisions are based on the roles of individual users within the organization.
identity_management
Handles the creation, storage, and management of digital identities on the blockchain.

dai.go: Manages Decentralized Autonomic Identities that can perform autonomous actions based on pre-defined rules.
did.go: Focuses on the management of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), which provide a way to verify digital identities without central authorities.
federation.go: Facilitates identity federation, allowing identities to be portable and recognizable across different blockchain systems.
identity_management.go: The core module that integrates various identity management functionalities.
identity_verification
Ensures the accuracy and integrity of user identities through various verification mechanisms.

continuous_auth.go: Implements continuous authentication processes to verify identities dynamically and continuously.
identity_verification.go: The central module for identity verification processes within the network.
mfa.go: Implements Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) to enhance security by requiring multiple methods of identity verification.
smart_contracts.go: Utilizes smart contracts to automate and secure identity verification processes.
zkp.go: Implements Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for privacy-preserving identity verification.
privacy_management
Focuses on maintaining user data confidentiality and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

compliance.go: Manages regulatory compliance with laws such as GDPR and HIPAA, integrating legal requirements directly into the platform's operation.

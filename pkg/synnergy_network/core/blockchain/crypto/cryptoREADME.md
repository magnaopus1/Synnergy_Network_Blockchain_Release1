## Features

### Data Integrity and Security
- **Unique Hash Generation**: Ensures the integrity and immutability of the data by generating unique hashes for each block and transaction.
- **Tamper Detection**: Any alteration to the data can be immediately detected due to the sensitivity of the hashing algorithms.

### Enhanced Wallet Security
- **Secure Private Keys**: Scrypt secures private keys against brute-force attacks, ensuring that users' digital assets are protected.
- **Memory-Intensive Processes**: The computational and memory requirements of Scrypt and Argon2 make it challenging for attackers to compromise wallet security.

### Efficient and Secure Mining
- **Memory-Hard Hashing**: Argon2's memory-hard properties make mining more secure and resistant to attacks, ensuring the network's stability.
- **Customizable Parameters**: The ability to adjust Argon2's parameters allows the network to maintain optimal mining difficulty and resource allocation.

### Digital Signatures
- **Transaction Authentication**: Utilizes ECDSA and RSA for transaction authentication, ensuring that transactions are signed by the sender's private key and verified by network participants using the corresponding public key.
- **Multi-Signature Support**: Allows for multi-signature transactions, requiring multiple private keys to authorize a transaction, thereby increasing security.

### Asymmetric Encryption

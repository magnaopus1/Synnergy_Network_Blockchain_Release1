Rollups
Overview
Rollups are a crucial component of the Synnergy Network's Layer 2 solution, designed to enhance the scalability, throughput, and efficiency of the blockchain. Rollups enable the network to handle a significantly higher volume of transactions by aggregating them into a single batch, which is then processed and verified off-chain. This approach not only reduces the computational load on the main chain but also minimizes transaction fees and latency, making Synnergy Network a highly efficient and scalable blockchain solution.
Rollups in the Synnergy Network are implemented using both Optimistic Rollups and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Rollups, each offering distinct advantages. Optimistic Rollups assume that transactions are valid by default and require a challenge period during which any incorrect transactions can be disputed. ZK Rollups, on the other hand, utilize zero-knowledge proofs to ensure the correctness of the transactions, providing strong security guarantees and reducing the need for a challenge period.
1.Scalability Enhancements
1.1 Aggregation of Multiple Transactions into a Single Batch
In Synnergy Network, rollups utilize advanced data compression algorithms to aggregate numerous individual transactions into a single batch. This aggregation reduces the volume of data that needs to be processed and stored on the main chain, effectively optimizing the network's bandwidth usage. The aggregation process is governed by sophisticated smart contracts that verify the authenticity and integrity of each transaction within the batch before submission. These contracts employ cryptographic techniques such as Merkle trees to ensure that the batch's integrity is maintained, enabling efficient verification with minimal computational overhead.
Additionally, Synnergy Network introduces "Dynamic Batch Sizing," an innovative feature that adapts the batch size based on network conditions and transaction demand. This adaptive mechanism ensures optimal use of network resources, providing flexibility during varying levels of network activity and preventing congestion during peak periods.
1.2 Reduction in the Number of On-Chain Transactions
To minimize the number of on-chain transactions, Synnergy Network employs a dual-layer transaction validation system. In this system, preliminary validation occurs off-chain within the rollup layer, where transactions are checked for basic validity criteria. Only aggregated transaction proofs and necessary state changes are submitted to the main chain. This approach significantly reduces the number of on-chain interactions, alleviating network congestion and preserving the main chain's computational resources.
Furthermore, the network leverages "Delayed Execution" techniques, where transactions can be batched and held for processing during off-peak times. This scheduling flexibility reduces peak-time congestion and helps stabilize transaction processing times across the network.
1.3 Increased Throughput Allowing for a Higher Number of Transactions per Second (TPS)
Synnergy Network's rollup architecture is designed to maximize throughput, achieving significantly higher transactions per second (TPS) compared to traditional blockchain systems. This is achieved through parallel processing capabilities, where multiple rollup chains operate concurrently, each managing a subset of the overall transaction load. This parallelism is facilitated by a "Sharded Rollup" approach, where the network is divided into shards, each responsible for processing and validating transactions independently. This sharding not only enhances scalability but also improves fault tolerance and network resilience.
To further increase throughput, Synnergy Network introduces "Predictive Load Balancing," an advanced algorithm that dynamically allocates transactions to different rollup chains based on real-time network analytics. This system predicts potential bottlenecks and redistributes the load accordingly, ensuring smooth and efficient transaction processing even under high demand.
2.Cost Efficiency
2.1 Significant Reduction in Gas Fees Due to the Batch Processing of Transactions
Synnergy Network's rollups significantly reduce gas fees by processing transactions in batches. This batch processing approach distributes the gas cost across multiple transactions, effectively lowering the fee per individual transaction. The network employs a "Hierarchical Fee Structure," where transaction fees are tiered based on the priority and type of transaction. This structure allows users to choose the fee tier that best suits their needs, optimizing the cost-efficiency of the system.
Additionally, Synnergy Network introduces "Fee Optimization Algorithms" that analyze transaction patterns and adjust fees dynamically. These algorithms consider factors such as network congestion, transaction urgency, and user history to provide the most cost-effective fee structure, further reducing the financial burden on users.
2.2 Lower Computational Costs for Transaction Validation on the Main Chain
The computational cost for transaction validation on the main chain is minimized by offloading the majority of computational work to the rollup layer. In this design, complex transaction processing, including signature verification and state changes, occurs within the rollup, while the main chain only handles aggregate data and proof verification. This separation of concerns not only reduces the computational load on the main chain but also enhances the overall efficiency of the blockchain.
Synnergy Network also incorporates "Asynchronous Validation" mechanisms, allowing the rollup layer to process transactions independently of the main chain. This decoupling enables more efficient resource utilization, as the main chain validators can focus on verifying aggregate proofs and state updates, rather than individual transactions.
3.Optimistic Rollups
3.1 Contracts: Smart Contracts Manage Transaction Submission and Dispute Resolution
In Synnergy Network's Optimistic Rollups, smart contracts play a central role in managing transaction submission and dispute resolution. These contracts are designed with a modular architecture, allowing for easy upgrades and integration of new features.

To enhance performance, nodes are equipped with "Adaptive Consensus Protocols," which optimize the consensus process based on real-time network conditions. These protocols can dynamically adjust consensus parameters, such as block size and validation time, ensuring efficient operation even under varying loads.
3.4 Operator: Manages the Rollup, Including Transaction Sequencing and Batching
Operators in the Synnergy Network are tasked with managing the rollup, including sequencing transactions and batching them for submission to the main chain. Operators utilize "Predictive Sequencing Algorithms," which analyze historical data and network activity to predict the optimal sequence for transactions. This predictive capability enhances the efficiency of transaction processing and reduces the likelihood of bottlenecks.
Operators also implement "Security Monitoring Systems" that continuously scan for anomalies or suspicious activities within the rollup. These systems are integrated with a network-wide "Alert and Response Framework," enabling rapid response to potential security threats and ensuring the integrity and security of the rollup.

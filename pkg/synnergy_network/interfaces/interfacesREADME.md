Overview
The interfaces package contains:

CLI Tools (cli_tools.go): A suite of command-line utilities for blockchain management tasks like wallet creation, transaction submission, and node status checks.
REST API (rest_api.go): Provides HTTP endpoints for querying blockchain data, submitting transactions, and managing nodes.
Installation
Before using the interfaces, ensure you have installed all required dependencies. Here's how to get started:

Install Go (version 1.16 or later recommended).
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the interfaces directory.
Run go build to compile the source files.
Usage
CLI Tools
The CLI tools offer a variety of commands:

Encrypt/Decrypt Data: Secure your sensitive data using robust encryption standards before transmission.
Node Management: Check the status of nodes in your network and manage them effectively.
Commands

# Encrypt data
./cli_tools encrypt <data> <password>

# Decrypt data
./cli_tools decrypt <encryptedData> <password>

# Check node status
./cli_tools node_status

REST API
The REST API provides endpoints for real-time interaction with the blockchain:

Get Block: Retrieve details of a block by its hash.
Post Transaction: Submit a new transaction to the blockchain.
Get Node Status: Get the operational status of a node.
Endpoints

GET /block/:hash
POST /transaction
GET /node/status


Security Features
Encryption: We use Scrypt for key derivation and AES-256-GCM for data encryption to ensure the security of data at rest and in transit.
Access Controls: Methods are protected with JWT-based authentication to ensure that only authorized users can perform sensitive operations.
Advanced Configuration
Environment Variables: Set environment variables for database connections, API keys, and other sensitive configurations.
Custom Middleware: Implement custom middleware for logging, error handling, and API rate limiting.
Troubleshooting
Ensure all environment dependencies are properly installed and configured.
Check logs for error messages and stack traces.
Use verbose or debug mode for detailed operational logs.

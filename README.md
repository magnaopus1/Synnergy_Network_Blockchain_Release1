# Synnergy_Network_Blockchain_Release1
NON-PRODUCTION ATM. Synnergy Network is a blockchain built on new technology incorporating Ai into blockchain technology. It runs on a proof of work, proof of stake and proof of history hybrid cosensus mechanism. Its native coin is Synthron Coin.

If you are a developer and would like to contribute to this project to ensure it works from initial inception and want to find out more follow us on twitter:@SynnergyNetwork. Remuneration will be a valid share of the genesis block and ongoing creator residual share. 

This is part of the Synthron Ecosystem Project from Magna Opus Technologies Ltd.
